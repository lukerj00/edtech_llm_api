Many people in Czechoslovakia were happy about this changes. \\nHowever, the Soviet Union, which controled Czechoslovakia at the time, didn't like these reforms. They thought Dub훾ek was going to far and worried that other countrys might want similar changes. \\nIn August 1968, the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countrys sent tanks and soldiers into Czechoslovakia. They wanted to stop the reforms and keep control This invasion ended the Prague Spring. \\nAfter the invasion, Dub훾ek was removed from power. The reforms were reversed, and Soviet control was tightend again. This event showed how much power the Soviet Union had over it's satellite states during the Cold War.",
